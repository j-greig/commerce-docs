# Customer Model

A customer record is created for both guests and registered users. It is used to store information about the user.

You can get the current customer model in your templates with:

```
{% set customer = craft.commerce.getCustomer() %}
```

If the current customer is a guest, then the `userId` attribute will be null.

If you need to access the email address of the customer, do so from the order with `order.email`.

If you add the [Customer Info](customer-info.md) field to the user profile, you can get the userâ€™s related customer model returned for that user.
